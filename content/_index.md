## Welcome to FreeCon.ga

Here you'll find the means **to free your Conga** vacuum cleaning
robot from the cloud, so you can get rid of that *little round spy*
that you have at home, scanning your house and reporting back to
some unknown obscure and -for sure- not privacy concerned
company.

By the way, this is the kind of Congas that we liberate:

This is still a **work in progress** thing, but with a lot of effort
already done and with (very) promising results already.

You can explore [our repository](https://gitlab.com/freeconga/stuff). The devices we are aiming at are [these Congas](/page/congas).
