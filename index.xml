Requirements Valetudo integrated into Home assistant Api Swagger available (For congatudo, just add a valid port for webui in the addon configuration) Valetudo should have a fixed IP Steps In configuration.yaml add the code below to get sensors build from the valetudo api every 5 seconds
rest: - scan_interval: 5 resource: &amp;#34;http://&amp;lt;valetudo_or_ha_ip&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;valetudo_port&amp;gt;/api/v2/robot/state/attributes&amp;#34; sensor: - name: &amp;#34;Vacuum last clean area&amp;#34; value_template: &amp;#34;{{ value_json[4][&amp;#39;value&amp;#39;] }}&amp;#34; state_class: &amp;#34;measurement&amp;#34; json_attributes_path: &amp;#34;$[4]&amp;#34; json_attributes: - __class - metadata - type - value - name: &amp;#34;Vacuum last clean duration&amp;#34; value_template: &amp;#34;{{ value_json[3][&amp;#39;value&amp;#39;] }}&amp;#34; device_class: &amp;#34;timestamp&amp;#34; state_class: &amp;#34;total&amp;#34; json_attributes_path: &amp;#34;$[3]&amp;#34; json_attributes: - __class - metadata - type - value Now, you have sensors for both time and area measures but just in default units, so in order to get them in human readable units, you are able to build virtual templated sensors.</description></item><item><title>Empower Your Conga Voice</title><link>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/empower-your-conga-voice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:06:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/empower-your-conga-voice/</guid><description>Goal Conga 4090 is able to talk instead of just beep to us, so here it is a guide to get it
Requirements A rooted conga At writing time, we just test in 4090 conga model, in other model some people already experimented some trouble. Please, do it just if you know what are you doing.
Steps It is a good practice to do a back up if all the files we are going to handle, so:</description></item><item><title>Clean Me</title><link>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/clean-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 19:16:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/clean-me/</guid><description>Goal Get your vacuum close to your bin once the tank is full
Requirements Valetudo integrated into Home assistant Tank percentage sensor available (i.e. with this tuto) A defined spot in valetudo Steps Once the tank percentage sensor is available, this automation is easy just taking care about the actions you may need. We are going to trigger this action every time the vacuum is in the dock for more than 1h, but it will trigger just in case of the tank percentage sensor above of 100.</description></item><item><title>Time and Tank Virtual Sensors</title><link>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/time-and-tank-virtual-sensors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 18:57:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/time-and-tank-virtual-sensors/</guid><description>Goal Valetudo is so great, but its home assistant integration miss out some good sensors like the time, area and tank fill percentage.
With this guide, you are going to learn how to create virtual sensor to get the cleaning time and tank percentage based on this time.
Requirements Valetudo integrated into Home assistant Steps Create one input date time helper. In this example the helper will be called RobotStartCleaningTime, being an date and time helper, so the id of this helper will be: input_datetime.</description></item><item><title>Hey Google Clean My Room</title><link>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/hey-google-clean-my-room/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 11:29:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://congatudo.cloud/blog/hey-google-clean-my-room/</guid><description>Goal Say &amp;ldquo;Hey Google, clean my room&amp;rdquo; to trigger your conga to clean that room
Requirements Valetudo integrated into Home assistant Defined zones in Valetudo (or segments) Google assistant integrated in home assistant Vacuum domain exposed from home assistant to Google assistant Steps Once you already know your zone IDs (under info button in zone section from Valetudo), yoy may have to create a script in home assistant to trigger that action in valetudo.</description></item><item><title>About us</title><link>https://congatudo.cloud/page/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://congatudo.cloud/page/about/</guid><description>A group o people interested in technology, privacy and -obviously- vacuum cleanning robots üòÅ
